create a patch using diff
$ diff -Naur original_file modified_file > file.patch

patch a file
$ patch < file.patch


Create a Patch From a Source Tree
$ diff -Naur /usr/src/openvpn-2.3.2 /usr/src/openvpn-2.3.4 > openvpn.patch

Apply Patch File to a Source Code Tree
# patch -p3 < /root/openvpn.patch

-p3 tells the patch command to skip 3 leading slashes from the filenames present in the patch file. In our case, the filename in patch file is “/usr/src/openvpn-2.3.2/aclocal.m4”, since you have given “-p3”, 3 leading slashes, i.e. until /usr/src/ is ignored.


Take a Backup before Applying the Patch using -b
$ patch -b < hello.patch


Validate the Patch without Applying
$ patch --dry-run < hello.patch


Reverse a Patch that is Already Applied
$ patch -R < hello.patch
